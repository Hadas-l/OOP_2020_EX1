About the project:
	
	This project represent bi-directional weighted
	graph.

	Graph is basicaly an HashMap of nodes.
	Algo gives you the option to check if your graph is connected,
	find shortes path, and shortest distance between two nodes.

	- classes are implementing Interfaces written by Boaz.

Getting Started:

	- build a Graph object using WGraph_DS class.
	- add nodes to graph using Graph.addnode(<key>)
	- connect between nodes using Graph.connect(<key1>, <key2>, weight)
	- build a Algo object using WGraph_Algo class.
	- check if your graph is connected via Algo.isConnected()
	- find shortest path via Algo.shortestPath(<src_key>, <dest_key>)
	- find shortest distance via Algo.shortestPathDist(<src_key>, <dest_key>)
